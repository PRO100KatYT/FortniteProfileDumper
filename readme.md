# Fortnite Response Dumper

This program allows you to dump many Fortnite responses.

---
### Features:
- Multiple account support with two login methods: refresh token and device auth.
- The program is able to dump:
  - account and global cloudstorage,
  - user profiles and other's Save the World profiles,
  - account information,
  - BR stats & inventory,
  - user friendlists,
  - catalog responses,
  - contentpages,
  - discovery tab responses,
  - keychain,
  - timeline,
  - theater (stw world).

- A config file where you can choose which responses to dump.
---
### Changelog:
What's new in the 1.6.0 update:
- Added the option to dump MOTDs for 6 game modes (stw, sparks, delmar, br, juno, eco).
  - You can toggle this feature in config.ini
- Update checker at the start of the program (togglable via config)
- Fixed a bug which caused the account Cloudstorage to dump only when Dump_Friendslist & Dump_Account_Cloudstorage were enabled at the same time, instead of doing so only when Dump_Account_Cloudstorage was enabled.
- Fixed the program not dumping the friendlist when the account has more than 100 friends added ([Issue #8](https://github.com/PRO100KatYT/FortniteResponseDumper/issues/8)).
- The program will no longer make a folder for Discovery images when the config option for dumping images is set to false.
- Added a .gitignore file to the repository.
- Tweaked the code a little bit (e.g. made the config part of the program a bit clearer to read).

### How to use it?

- After starting the FortniteResponseDumper.py for the first time (or after deleting the config.ini file) you will be asked if you want to start the config setup process or use the default config values. If you want to start the setup, type 1, if no, type 2.

- Next, you will be asked if you are logged into your Epic account in your browser. If yes, type 1, if no, type 2.

- After you'll press ENTER, an Epic Games website will open. From there, login if you are not already logged into your Epic account.

- Then a page should open with content similar to this:

```json
{"redirectUrl":"https://localhost/launcher/authorized?code=930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","authorizationCode":"930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","sid":null}
```
or this:
```json
{"redirectUrl":"com.epicgames.fortnite://fnauth/?code=930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","authorizationCode":"930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","sid":null}
```

- Copy the code (e.g. 930884289b5852842271e9027376a527), paste it into the program and press enter.

- If all went well, the program will say it has generated the auth.json file successfully.

- Now you can either dump your account's responses or someone else's Save the World profiles (campaign, common_public and generated by the program profile0 profile).
